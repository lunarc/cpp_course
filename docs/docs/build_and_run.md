# Building and running C++ code

To install and run C++, you will need a compiler. There are several compilers available for C++ that work on all major platforms. For this course, we will be using the GNU C++ compiler. Along with the compiler, it is recommended to have a good text editor that has support for C++. To further simplify the process of compiling, running, and debugging C++ code, a development environment is recommended. In this course, we will use Qt Creator, which is an advanced environment specifically designed for C++. It provides features such as building, debugging, and running both command line and graphical applications using Qt.

As we are not going to develop commercial code in this course we can download and use the open source version of Qt Creator, which can be downloaded from the following URL:
