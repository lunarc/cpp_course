# Building and running C++ code

To install and run C++, you will need a compiler. There are several compilers available for C++ that work on all major platforms. For this course, we will be using the GNU C++ compiler. Along with the compiler, it is recommended to have a good text editor that has support for C++. To further simplify the process of compiling, running, and debugging C++ code, a development environment is recommended. In this course, we will use Qt Creator, which is an advanced environment specifically designed for C++. It provides features such as building, debugging, and running both command line and graphical applications using Qt.
